## Project Ivy: the new (new) Angular compiler

Soooo.... This is the 4th major release of Angular (2, 4, 5, 6), and the 3rd rewrite of the compiler!

For those who don't know: Angular compiles your templates into equivalent TypeScript code.
This TypeScript code is then compiled along the TypeSCript you wrote into JavaScript code,
and the result is shipped to your users.
And we are now on the 3rd version of this Angular compiler
(the first was in the original release Angular 2.0, and the second in [Angular 4.0](/2017/04/28/what-is-new-angular-4)).

This new version of the compiler does not change how you write your templates,
but comes with improvements in several fields:

- build time
- bundle size

All our materials ([ebook](https://books.ninja-squad.com/angular), [online training (Pro Pack)](https://angular-exercises.ninja-squad.com/) and [training](http://ninja-squad.com/training/angular)) are up-to-date with these changes if you want to learn more!
