[Angular CLI 13.2.0](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/releases/tag/13.2.0) is out!âœ¨

If you want to upgrade to 13.2.0 without pain (or to any other version, by the way), I have created a Github project to help: [angular-cli-diff](https://github.com/cexbrayat/angular-cli-diff). Choose the version you're currently using (12.2.0 for example), and the target version (13.2.0 for example), and it gives you a diff of all files created by the CLI: [angular-cli-diff/compare/12.2.0...13.2.0](https://github.com/cexbrayat/angular-cli-diff/compare/12.2.0...13.2.0).
It can be a great help along with the official `ng update @angular/core @angular/cli` command.
You have no excuse for staying behind anymore!

Let's see what we've got in this release.

## Clean stale cache

The CLI has a cache system since v13.0 (see [our article](/2021/11/03/angular-cli-13.0/)),
but there is no option to clean the cache (other than manually deleting the `.angular` folder). This is an issue, as the cache grows bigger and bigger.
This release does not add a command to clean the cache,
but the CLI will now automatically purge stale entries from the cache when a new version of the CLI is used.

## i18n

The CLI now accepts the `i18nDuplicateTranslation` option, which allows you to specify whether to throw an error when a translation is duplicated, by specifying `"warning"`, `"error"` or `"ignore"`. The default value is `"warning"`.

## Tailwind CSS v3 support

All is in the title: the CLI now supports [Tailwind CSS v3](https://tailwindcss.com/) out of the box!
