You know that we are Angular fans, but we also really enjoy Vue. Vue 3.0 is a complete rewrite of Vue 2.x. It brings first class TypeScript support, a new way of defining components with the Composition API, and tons of cool stuff. I have been contributing to the framework and the popular libraries of the eco-system for a while. I really enjoy it, and this ebook and online training contain everything I learnt.

As usual, you can **pay what you want** for our ebook üòä. You can also give part of the price to **support the Vue team**. The ebook is DRM-free, available in all formats, and has an **English and a French version**.

We're really excited to share our online training as well, the **Vue Pro Pack**, with 25+ exercises to build the [Vue version of Ponyracer](https://vue-ponyracer.ninja-squad.com). You'll get to build the application step by step, with the instructions, tests and solution provided in each exercise. Check out [https://vue-exercises.ninja-squad.com](https://vue-exercises.ninja-squad.com) if you want to try the first exercises for free!

Vue 3.0 is not stable yet, but as we did for our Angular materials, we'll keep everything up-to-date and add new chapters/exercises with the new releases. And all updates will be free of course!

As more than a thousand people already enjoyed our Angular Pro Pack, but some could not afford it, we decided to set the price of our Vue Pro Pack to **99‚Ç¨ for an unlimited personal licence**. And, of course, teams get a discount when buying several ones.

And to celebrate the release, we decided to also **lower the price of our [Angular Pro Pack](https://books.ninja-squad.com/angular) to the same price of 99‚Ç¨**. So this is good news for both the Angular fans and the Vue curious.

Take care in these tough times. We hope you'll enjoy discovering and learning Vue 3 as much as we did ‚ù§Ô∏è.
