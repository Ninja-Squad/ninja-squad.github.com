[Angular CLI 12.1.0](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/releases/tag/v12.1.0) is out!âœ¨

If you want to upgrade to 12.1.0 without pain (or to any other version, by the way), I have created a Github project to help: [angular-cli-diff](https://github.com/cexbrayat/angular-cli-diff). Choose the version you're currently using (12.0.0 for example), and the target version (12.1.0 for example), and it gives you a diff of all files created by the CLI: [angular-cli-diff/compare/12.0.0...12.1.0](https://github.com/cexbrayat/angular-cli-diff/compare/12.0.0...12.1.0).
It can be a great help along with the official `ng update @angular/core @angular/cli` command.
You have no excuse for staying behind anymore!

Let's see what we've got in this release.

## TypeScript 4.3

Angular now supports TS 4.3, and so does the CLI.
You can read the [announcement post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-3/)
on the Microsoft blog to learn more about the new TS features.

## Production configuration

The `--prod` flag of `ng build` and `ng serve` is deprecated since CLI v12.
When upgrading to v12.1, a migration will run and replace the deprecated `--prod` with `--configuration production` in the scripts section of the `package.json`.

## ng generate

When generating a component, it is now possible to specify `style=none` to avoid generating a style file.
Previously it was only possible to specify `css`, `scss`, `sass` or `less`,
all of which were generating a style file.

## Experimental faster builds

An experimental persistent build cache can be enabled by running:

    NG_PERSISTENT_BUILD_CACHE=1 ng serve

This should improve cold build times, as it causes `node_modules` to be treated as immutable by Webpack.
