This is a minor release, mainly to support TS v4.6.
But it also comes with a few improvements that are worth exploring: let's dive in!

## TypeScript 4.6

The reason of this v13.3 release is the support of TypeScript v4.6.
TS v4.6 was released in February, and the Angular team did not wanted to wait for the v14 release to support it (scheduled in May).

If you want to use the new `es2022` target, the improved control flow analysis or
the possibility to call code before `super()` in constructors, you now can.
Here are [the full release notes](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-6/) if you want to learn more about the new TypeScript version.

## Bundle size

The team refactored the codebase to make some errors, providers 
and tokens tree-shakable and removed a few useless classes (now that IE is no longer supported).
This should lead to slightly lighter bundles.

The code generated by the compiler has also been improved to allow chaining some instructions.
For example, consider a template like `<div><div><a>Hello</a></div></div>`.

Angular v13.2 generated:

    // simplified compiled template in ng v13.2
    elementStart(0, "div");
    elementStart(1, "div");
    element(2, "a");
    elementEnd();
    elementEnd();

Now, Angular v13.3 generates:

    // simplified compiled template in ng v13.3
    elementStart(0, "div")(1, "div")
    element(2, "a");
    elementEnd()();

This can make a little difference depending on your templates,
but not _that_ much, as the code that was previously generated was compressing very well.

## Forms

It is listed as a fix rather than a new feature, but I think this is noteworthy if you're using `ngModel` in forms: you can use a non-null assertion in the "banana-in-box" syntax:

{% raw %}
    <input [(ngModel)]="user.name!" />
    <!-- same as -->
    <input [ngModel]="user.name!" (ngModelChange)="user.name = $event">
{% endraw %}

This of course works for the "banana-in-box" syntax in general,
not only with `ngModel`.

That's all for this release, stay tuned!
