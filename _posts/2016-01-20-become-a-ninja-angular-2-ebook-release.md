# It's finally here!

After countless hours of work, we are very happy to release our ebook 'Become a ninja with Angular&nbsp;2'!

As we announced, the ebook is **DRM free**, available in **English** and **French**,
in every format you can dream of (**PDF, EPUB, MOBI, HTML**).
And, as for our previous ebook, you can **pay what you want** and **give as much you want to a charity**.

For our first ebook, we chose to support [a local charity helping kids in hospitals](http://www.docteursouris.fr/).
For this ebook, we want to help the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/),
because we deeply believe in a world with free expression and respect of privacy.

The proposed price for the ebook is 42€<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, but if you can't afford it,
because you're unemployed or still a student, feel free to give what you can.
If you want to support our work, feel free to give more, we will be deeply grateful :)

We are selling the ebook ourselves, using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/fr) as our payment solution.
When you buy the book, we send you an email with a link for the download and an invoice.
Don’t worry, we won't spam you, we'll just send you emails when we release a significant update.

The ebook covers all the things you have to know to start coding great apps in Angular&nbsp;2.
Check out [the content](https://books.ninja-squad.com/angular2#toc)!
A few chapters will be added when the framework is slightly more mature
(Remember that Angular&nbsp;2 is still in beta).
Of course, all future updates will be free if you buy the ebook now.

We are still working on the "Pro package", with a great set of exercises to build a full project step by step.
We are sure you're going to love it.
If you want to buy it later, don't worry, you'll have a discount if you already bought the ebook.

We really hope you'll enjoy your read and our exercises and we can't wait to hear what you think about it!

Now go and [buy it](https://books.ninja-squad.com/angular2#buy)!
